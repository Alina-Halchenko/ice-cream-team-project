                The best ice coffee here. This is a refreshing and very tasty
                drink for coffee lovers in the summer, which also invigorates.
                Especially, when it's made with passion.

                Great cafe with a good selection of quality ice cream. Any can
                be taken and given to children, because it is made from natural
                products and no chemicals. We go here often with my son.

                In this cafe you can order a milkshake with any taste. It's
                great that it is made with the addition of fresh fruits and
                berries. I am sure even those who do not like dairy products
                will like it.
